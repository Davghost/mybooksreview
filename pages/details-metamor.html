                    <em>The Metamorphosis</em> left me with an uncomfortable feeling â€” and I think that was the point. 
                    Watching Gregor slowly lose his place in the world just because he became different was sad, but painfully real. 
                    It made me think about how fragile acceptance is, even within a family. 
                    The story is strange, but it says a lot without needing many words.
