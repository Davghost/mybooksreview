I’m a student who enjoys meaningful reading.
This site was built with HTML and CSS — it’s my third project, but the first one I developed completely on my own.
Here, I share some of my favorite books — some I’ve already read, and others I hope to read someday.
It’s a static site for now, but in theory, you can add a book to the list.
