                    <em>The Prince</em> surprised me. I expected a cold, manipulative guide — 
                    but what I found was a brutally honest look at power and survival. It doesn't try to sound noble, 
                    just real. Even if I didn’t agree with everything, it made me think about how much of life — 
                    and leadership — is about understanding people as they truly are, not as we wish they were.
